              </ul> 
            <p>Bio:</p>
             <p>Floor Verhaegen is 21 years old and currently lives with 3 friends in a student house in Tilburg, where she studies communication and information sciences at the Tilburg University in Tilburg. She grew up in a family with 3 children, she is the youngest of three sisters. Her parents are still together and still live together in the parental home in Vught with their labrodoodle Bobby. 
              Besides her studies, Floor works at Buutvrij, a creative coffee café in the heart of Tilburg. She is also still twice a week on the field hockey field in Vugt, where she is still a loyal member. She plays field hockey in a friends team. 
              Among her friends, she is known as a sociable person, a listening ear and a creative person. She has an eye for detail, both in her studies and in her private life. She likes to be involved in styling and makes sure that every dinner party at her house is perfectly organized. She someone who regularly gifts herself a new piece of clothing, because she finds it important to look well-groomed. She gets inspiration for new outfits from Instagram and Tiktok. 
              So besides loving her regular things, like her regular field hockey club, that she still visits her parents weekly, she is also someone who loves harmony. Harmony within the family, between her friends and also definitely in her field hockey team. She does not like injustice, not in the world and not her team. She is an everyman's friend and would like everyone to be nice to each other and not talk behind each other's backs. 
              Despite having a rich social life both in Tilburg with her studies and her old friends in Vught, she finds it difficult to find a balance in it sometimes. To sometimes find herself in three places at once and give everyone equal attention. As much as she would like not to care what her friends think, it does keep her busy.

          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <p>The list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Our colour pallet
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F6AFCA;"></span>
                  #F6AFCA 
                  <p>The choice for the light pink as primary color refers to the female part of our target group. Pinks stands for passion, tenderness, and cute. Our target group has a passion for the sport they play, and by using this pink we aim to create a passioned environment. Thereby, stands the pink for tenderness. We want to inspire people to be kind to each other, so that there will be less negativity and more positivity. And don’t forget the looks, because they are everything to our target group. With, especially the light pink, we want to create a cute logo and add the cuteness to the website so that in the end we have created a cute, tender and passionate environment for our target audience.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #496AFE;"></span>
                  #496AFE  
                  <p>The choice for the bright blue as secondary color refers to the color of the hockey fields. It also stands for harmony, security, and truthfulness. With Stick Together we want to create harmony within the team, and give them a secure atmosphere. Although we are all for positivity we don’t want people to pretend, we want truthfulness. Especially since our target group is very fond of honesty. All this together is the reason to choose this color for our pallet.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #0D9277;"></span>
                  #0D9277   
                  <p>The choice for the green color as secondary color refers also to the color of the hockey fields. Green stands for experienced, trusted, and healing. This perfectly connects with the message we as Stick Together want to convey. We offer experiences to learn to trust your team and celebrate victories and loses together. Green also refers to nature, since our target audience plays field hockey which is outside. Additionally, the activities we offer will be held outside in a green area.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #EE4C39 ;"></span>
                  #EE4C39   
                  <p>The choice for the bright red/ orange as a primary color refers to battle we want to overcome with Stick Together. The color stands for judge and selfish. These negative emotion are mentioned by our target group as a stumbling block in the team. We want to connect people together and make them less selfish and teach them to not immediately judge people. That is why we use this color in combination with the pink to find a perfect balance. Since the goal in the end is to have a well balanced team who work together and connect.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #EDE8E8;"></span>
                  #EDE8E8  
                  <p>The choice for the beige as a secondary color refers to the rest and the balance. Thereby, we have looked at the brands which our target group like a lot, such as Marie Claire, Linda Meiden, and My Jewellery. All these brand use a neutral colors combined with bright colors. So to follow the trend and to appeal to our target group we chose this color pallet. </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Font choices</li>
            <h3 class="roboto-black">Roboto</h3>
              <p>The Roboto font chosen for our main titles and second titles. It is a clear and pretty simple font. It fits the brands value of respect. Additionally, we chose to go for a clear font since brand that inspire our target audience also use a clear and simple font. Such as Adidas and Osaka. With this choice we want to appeal create familiarity.</p>
            <h3 class="Raleway">Raleway</h3>
              <p>The Raleway font we used as our body font. It is an elegant and modern font which is the reason we chose it. Keeping up with the time and the newest trends is very important for our target audience. The Raleway font is both timeless and modern, which is why it fits the target audience now and still will over time. It also fits perfect with the Roboto font, to keep up the teamwork. </p>
            <li>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
            <p>One of our values is fun which is why we changed up the structure in our value section. Our target audience is Gen Z, so they can manage the online world well. That is why our choice landed on separate pages per category. Organization wise we believe that this is also natural for Gen Z since multiple websites are build this way. We did however decided on a permanent navigation bar on the top, so that the website would be easy to navigate at all times. </p>
            <li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
            <p>At the home page we decided to first provide our slogan and immediately invite users to read more. We decided to do this to make the website inviting. Secondly we offer a sneak peak of our product to make the user curious, we do provide a button to our product so that they are willing to click further and that they don’t get discouraged. Lastly we provide one of our Instagram posts, which we also used for our marketing and communication campaign, together with and link to our Instagram. Instagram is the most used app among our target audience and therefore maybe even more important than the website. So with guiding them to our Instagram they can also check there what we provide. </p>
            <p>Our second page is the Discover our world page. On this page you find all the information about the Brand and the team. We have chosen to give a polaroid style to the pictures, so that it would be like memories and thus create a pleasant environment. All the corners of the shapes are round and the shape used the most is the circle. We have chosen for this to give our website a playful effect which suits our value fun. Thereby, it looks friendly which is an important value of the target group. Finally, it fits the value sportsmanship since circles and rounded corners are organic shapes. On the Discover Our World page we also chose to show the most of our colors again for that playful and fun effect. </p>
            <p>Our third page is the What We Offer page. On the page you find three packages all shaped with a picture first and then the text just like a polaroid. This is because with our teambuilding activities we want to make memories, and memories you capture in a photograph. The corners are round to give a friendly effect as explained before. At the bottom of every page is a footer where there is access to our Instagram account. This is to make it easy to follow us, and create a Stick Together team. </p>
            <p>Our fourth and last page is the contact page. There are many links to this page since we are eager for people to sign up. Even if they don’t want to buy the package they can ask us questions. The button of the sign up is the same as in all buttons form the other pages. We did this to create cohesiveness. The corners of the sign up sheet are again rounded and it looks like the polaroid without the picture to make it a whole.</p>
            <p>Lastly all colors and fonts that are used are also in our marketing campaign. We used the same colors and fonts to create an aesthetic so that we would be easy recognizable and that there would be a good link to the marketing strategy and the website. </p>

          <!-- End Production, start Marketing -->

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>For our marketing campaign, we chose to post different types of content, both as the type of content and in terms of goal for the content. Moreover, alternating in type of content, such as posts, stories and reels would also be good for getting higher in the algorithm. 
			  <br> <br>
			  We got the inspiration for the content mainly from Instagram accounts, such as @NSBML, @Linda.meiden and @haarclipvanmarieclaire. These are Instagram accounts that are popular among our target group or have the same target group as us. Something that is very typical of these channels is that they use a lot of colour, don't necessarily post a lot of reels, but very much anticipate on recognition. They make sure that followers recognize themselves in the post and also encourage to start recognizing yourself in a post. In addition to this, these channels also want to spread positivity, also something we like to do. 
			  <br> <br> 
			  Examples of what we want to post: 
		  <li> Inspirational quotes</li>
			  <li> Meme reels</li>
			  <li> Outfit inspiration </li>
			  <li> Who are you?</li>
			  <li> Supportive content on matchdays</li>
			  
			  <br>
			  <p> At last we wanted to create unity between our website and our social media with our marketing plan. And that the content we’ve created was close to our target group. That we have been very attuned to that particular audience.  </p>
</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
	<p> General:</p>
          <p>If we can say one thing about this project is that we've tried, things have gone well, things have gone differently, but most of all we've learned a lot. <br> 
			  At the beginning of the project, we took the wrong approach, which caused a delay for us in the project and therefore we didn’t had that much time to execute our campaign as fast as we wanted to in the beginning. And as a result, we made the decision to focus completely on Instagram for marketing. Also because Instagram has a lot features as stated before in this report. We did added our Tiktok objectives and ideas to this report as part of the reflection. <br> The red threat hrough this whole marketing project is that’ve been too much of a perfectionist. In the report will be explained when and how, but one of the biggest thing we’ve learned is to let it go sometimes and that that is also okay. And you can even get good result if you do. &nbsp;</p>
	<p> What worked and what didn't?</p>
	<p> What worked?</p>
	<li> Inspirational shopping pages (see post 7 and 11). </li>
	<li> Make one personal responsible for the marketing. In de last 1,5 week we had still had a lot to do, so we made the decision that Tamar was gonna be responsible for the Marketing and social media. This made posting a lot easier. </li>
	<li> Wat voor de rest nog opvallend was, dat de posts die maar maximaal </li>
	<p> What didn't work?</p>
	<li> Quote posts didn’t go as expected. We thought that these posts would have done better since the style of the quotes is very popular on Pinterest and Instagram. </li>
	<li> Putting a posts in the concepts of Instagram. We thought that once you’ve put something in concepts that everyone had access to that post. But we didn’t. And therefore post 2 and the first stories were delayed. </li>
	<li> We also wanted to have an direct interaction with our followers, because we thought is was nice to make them part of content and therefore they could feel more connected to our account. We posted an Instagram story with a question sticker and we posted a general post with a question to answer in the comments. But both posts didn’t work out and we got zero reactions. </li>
	
	<p> WHAT WENT AS EXPECTED AND WHAT DIDN’T? </p>
	<p> WHAT WENT AS EXPECTED?</p>
	<li> We did expect that the shopping posts would do well. We saw this in previous marketing projects, that if you tag brands or other relevant people we got more views and that the brands we’ve tagged liked our posts as well. And indeed our ‘’shopping posts’’ got the most views and even a few companies (@Knekkinl, @dwrslabel and @brouwerijhetij) we tagged liked our posts. </li>
	<li> We also acted on the buying behaviour of gen-z with these posts. Generation-Z is trend-sensitive and often buy a new item for a good feeling. And the inspiration for new items they get mainly through social media. </li>
	<li> We also expected that our feed would look nice, because we are all very passionate about the design aspect of social media marketing. </li>
	
	<p> WHAT DIDN’T WENT AS EXPECTED? </p>
	<li> At the beginning, we didn't take a strategic approach at all. There was a content calendar, but that was about it. There was not one person to post, so literally nothing got off the ground. The ideas were there, the qualities of the team were there, but there was 1 big enemy and that was communication. Communication was lacking. There was no one taking the lead and that's a shame. As a result, we communicated past each other and arrived at a concrete plan too late, leaving us behind. </li>
	<li> When we had our first feedback session in class, multiple classmates gave us the tip to post more reels, and especially reels that are in meme style. A lot of people like to send those videos to their friends and tag them in the comments. So we did. We started posting reels related to the hockey people, but they didn’t achieved the reach we expected. When we compared our account to other accounts, we thought that we could at least get 200 views per reel, but we didn’t. </li>
	<p> All our six reels together scored in total 388 views compared to 1200 views we expected to. </p>
	<p> For our account the normal posts did better. We got more views and engagement to our posts. If we look at the statistics 1/3 of our involved account were on our posts and not our reels. </p>
	<img src="images/Picture-1.jpg" alt="account engagement">
	<li> Stories didn’t worked out. We didn’t realize that stories would only be seen by our followers. And specially in the beginning we didn’t get any following and therefore the views on our stories were low and didn’t had any impact, not even a like.  </li>
	<li> At last we didn’t expect that it would take so long to get a lot of followers or at least 50. We think that people are nowadays more picky in following accounts. </li>
	
	<p> WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY? </p>
	<li> Definitely post more content. Let go of the perfectionism and just post. It sounds very easy to do, but we’re a team with all very perfectionistic people, which didn’t make it easy. We could easy spend 4 hour deciding on the fonts or a new colour to add to the styleguide. 
With more posts Instagram user could have clear view on our brand and made them maybe curious to follow us. 
</li>
	<li> Make 1 person responsible for the marketing part of the project. Then that person could delegate the tasks within marketing to team members. That would have made it more easy to execute the marketing plan. </li>
	<li> Stick to the planning. Making is a planning is one thing, but stick to it, is another thing. That is something we didn’t and therefore we got lost. </li>
	<li> Make posts ahead and put them in a planning tool, so you don’t have to worry about if you have posted or not. </li>
	
	<p> COMMPARING TO THE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA PLAN?</p>
	<p> If we look back at our content planning you see that we didn’t post consistently and not according to our planning. This was all because of the points that we stated before in this report. Especially the posting times were not according to our content planning.
But if we look at our objectives we didn’t achieve the objective of 250 followers, we got 30 followers in total and approximately 17 of them were active (they saw our posts). Also the reach objective of an audience reach of 5000 was a little bit ambitious. In total we reached 776 accounts. Our most reach we got on the posts: 771 and on the reels: 112 views in total and on our stories: 29 views. This makes a total of 1497 views on our account. 
And of course are tiktok objectives not relevant because we didn’t use Tiktok in the end.
For the affective objective we wanted to encourage positive emotions such as bonding, enthusiasm and respect within the hockey community. We could anticipated more on this objective. We only made one post that really focused on positive support (post 6). Then the content would also be more in line with the content for our website. We were just more focused on which content got likes and views, instead of the message. 
For the response objective we wanted at least 100 interactions spread across 8 different posts. But in total we got 97 likes and 10 comments
</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
       <li> Would like to focus more on the sport itself now we posted mostly general stuff. Looking back on our content it could have been an account for a lifestyle brand and not necessarily a brand that wants to promote positivity in sports. So for the future we want to focus more on field hockey related content. This could include tricks, matched and news.</li>
	<li> We will also need to pay more attention on Instagram statistics. So that we really pay better attention to which hashtags worked well and which times worked well, we really haven't looked at that well enough now. </li>
	<li> We should also post more in English. Just to try if can get a bigger audience, since the posts will be understandable for more people. </li>
	<li> Lastly, we could also experiment with paid ads, to see what that does to engagement and we can get more followers.</li>
          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <p>Present and organize below all social media/online activities of the campaign. Context and material are according to the brand style, image, and vision. Images on the site are of high-quality, readable, and properly designed.</p>
