              </ul> 
            <p>Bio:</p>
             <p>Floor Verhaegen is 21 years old and currently lives with 3 friends in a student house in Tilburg, where she studies communication and information sciences at the Tilburg University in Tilburg. She grew up in a family with 3 children, she is the youngest of three sisters. Her parents are still together and still live together in the parental home in Vught with their labrodoodle Bobby. 
              Besides her studies, Floor works at Buutvrij, a creative coffee caf√© in the heart of Tilburg. She is also still twice a week on the field hockey field in Vugt, where she is still a loyal member. She plays field hockey in a friends team. 
              Among her friends, she is known as a sociable person, a listening ear and a creative person. She has an eye for detail, both in her studies and in her private life. She likes to be involved in styling and makes sure that every dinner party at her house is perfectly organized. She someone who regularly gifts herself a new piece of clothing, because she finds it important to look well-groomed. She gets inspiration for new outfits from Instagram and Tiktok. 
              So besides loving her regular things, like her regular field hockey club, that she still visits her parents weekly, she is also someone who loves harmony. Harmony within the family, between her friends and also definitely in her field hockey team. She does not like injustice, not in the world and not her team. She is an everyman's friend and would like everyone to be nice to each other and not talk behind each other's backs. 
              Despite having a rich social life both in Tilburg with her studies and her old friends in Vught, she finds it difficult to find a balance in it sometimes. To sometimes find herself in three places at once and give everyone equal attention. As much as she would like not to care what her friends think, it does keep her busy.

          <p>The list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Our colour pallet
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F6AFCA;"></span>
                  #F6AFCA 
                  <em>The choice for the light pink as primary color refers to the female part of our target group. Pinks stands for passion, tenderness, and cute. Our target group has a passion for the sport they play, and by using this pink we aim to create a passioned environment. Thereby, stands the pink for tenderness. We want to inspire people to be kind to each other, so that there will be less negativity and more positivity. And don‚Äôt forget the looks, because they are everything to our target group. With, especially the light pink, we want to create a cute logo and add the cuteness to the website so that in the end we have created a cute, tender and passionate environment for our target audience.</em>

                  #496AFE  
                  <em>The choice for the bright blue as secondary color refers to the color of the hockey fields. It also stands for harmony, security, and truthfulness. With Stick Together we want to create harmony within the team, and give them a secure atmosphere. Although we are all for positivity we don‚Äôt want people to pretend, we want truthfulness. Especially since our target group is very fond of honesty. All this together is the reason to choose this color for our pallet. </em>

                  #0D9277   
                  <em>The choice for the green color as secondary color refers also to the color of the hockey fields. Green stands for experienced, trusted, and healing. This perfectly connects with the message we as Stick Together want to convey. We offer experiences to learn to trust your team and celebrate victories and loses together. Green also refers to nature, since our target audience plays field hockey which is outside. Additionally, the activities we offer will be held outside in a green area. </em>

                  <em>The choice for the bright red/ orange as a primary color refers to battle we want to overcome with Stick Together. The color stands for judge and selfish. These negative emotion are mentioned by our target group as a stumbling block in the team. We want to connect people together and make them less selfish and teach them to not immediately judge people. That is why we use this color in combination with the pink to find a perfect balance. Since the goal in the end is to have a well balanced team who work together and connect.</em>

                  <em>The choice for the beige as a secondary color refers to the rest and the balance. Thereby, we have looked at the brands which our target group like a lot, such as Marie Claire, Linda Meiden, and My Jewellery. All these brand use a neutral colors combined with bright colors.
