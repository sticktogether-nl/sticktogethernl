              </ul> 
            <p>Bio:</p>
             <p>Floor Verhaegen is 21 years old and currently lives with 3 friends in a student house in Tilburg, where she studies communication and information sciences at the Tilburg University in Tilburg. She grew up in a family with 3 children, she is the youngest of three sisters. Her parents are still together and still live together in the parental home in Vught with their labrodoodle Bobby. 
              Besides her studies, Floor works at Buutvrij, a creative coffee caf√© in the heart of Tilburg. She is also still twice a week on the field hockey field in Vugt, where she is still a loyal member. She plays field hockey in a friends team. 
              Among her friends, she is known as a sociable person, a listening ear and a creative person. She has an eye for detail, both in her studies and in her private life. She likes to be involved in styling and makes sure that every dinner party at her house is perfectly organized. She someone who regularly gifts herself a new piece of clothing, because she finds it important to look well-groomed. She gets inspiration for new outfits from Instagram and Tiktok. 
              So besides loving her regular things, like her regular field hockey club, that she still visits her parents weekly, she is also someone who loves harmony. Harmony within the family, between her friends and also definitely in her field hockey team. She does not like injustice, not in the world and not her team. She is an everyman's friend and would like everyone to be nice to each other and not talk behind each other's backs. 
              Despite having a rich social life both in Tilburg with her studies and her old friends in Vught, she finds it difficult to find a balance in it sometimes. To sometimes find herself in three places at once and give everyone equal attention. As much as she would like not to care what her friends think, it does keep her busy.

          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <p>The list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Our colour pallet
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F6AFCA;"></span>
                  #F6AFCA 
                  <p>The choice for the light pink as primary color refers to the female part of our target group. Pinks stands for passion, tenderness, and cute. Our target group has a passion for the sport they play, and by using this pink we aim to create a passioned environment. Thereby, stands the pink for tenderness. We want to inspire people to be kind to each other, so that there will be less negativity and more positivity. And don‚Äôt forget the looks, because they are everything to our target group. With, especially the light pink, we want to create a cute logo and add the cuteness to the website so that in the end we have created a cute, tender and passionate environment for our target audience.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #496AFE;"></span>
                  #496AFE  
                  <p>The choice for the bright blue as secondary color refers to the color of the hockey fields. It also stands for harmony, security, and truthfulness. With Stick Together we want to create harmony within the team, and give them a secure atmosphere. Although we are all for positivity we don‚Äôt want people to pretend, we want truthfulness. Especially since our target group is very fond of honesty. All this together is the reason to choose this color for our pallet.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #0D9277;"></span>
                  #0D9277   
                  <p>The choice for the green color as secondary color refers also to the color of the hockey fields. Green stands for experienced, trusted, and healing. This perfectly connects with the message we as Stick Together want to convey. We offer experiences to learn to trust your team and celebrate victories and loses together. Green also refers to nature, since our target audience plays field hockey which is outside. Additionally, the activities we offer will be held outside in a green area.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #EE4C39 ;"></span>
                  #EE4C39   
                  <p>The choice for the bright red/ orange as a primary color refers to battle we want to overcome with Stick Together. The color stands for judge and selfish. These negative emotion are mentioned by our target group as a stumbling block in the team. We want to connect people together and make them less selfish and teach them to not immediately judge people. That is why we use this color in combination with the pink to find a perfect balance. Since the goal in the end is to have a well balanced team who work together and connect.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #EDE8E8;"></span>
                  #EDE8E8  
                  <p>The choice for the beige as a secondary color refers to the rest and the balance. Thereby, we have looked at the brands which our target group like a lot, such as Marie Claire, Linda Meiden, and My Jewellery. All these brand use a neutral colors combined with bright colors. So to follow the trend and to appeal to our target group we chose this color pallet. </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Font choices</li>
            <h3 class="roboto-black">Roboto</h3>
              <p>The Roboto font chosen for our main titles and second titles. It is a clear and pretty simple font. It fits the brands value of respect. Additionally, we chose to go for a clear font since brand that inspire our target audience also use a clear and simple font. Such as Adidas and Osaka. With this choice we want to appeal create familiarity.</p>
            <h3 class="Raleway">Raleway</h3>
              <p>The Raleway font we used as our body font. It is an elegant and modern font which is the reason we chose it. Keeping up with the time and the newest trends is very important for our target audience. The Raleway font is both timeless and modern, which is why it fits the target audience now and still will over time. It also fits perfect with the Roboto font, to keep up the teamwork. </p>
            <li>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
            <p>One of our values is fun which is why we changed up the structure in our value section. Our target audience is Gen Z, so they can manage the online world well. That is why our choice landed on separate pages per category. Organization wise we believe that this is also natural for Gen Z since multiple websites are build this way. We did however decided on a permanent navigation bar on the top, so that the website would be easy to navigate at all times. </p>
            <li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
            <p>At the home page we decided to first provide our slogan and immediately invite users to read more. We decided to do this to make the website inviting. Secondly we offer a sneak peak of our product to make the user curious, we do provide a button to our product so that they are willing to click further and that they don‚Äôt get discouraged. Lastly we provide one of our Instagram posts, which we also used for our marketing and communication campaign, together with and link to our Instagram. Instagram is the most used app among our target audience and therefore maybe even more important than the website. So with guiding them to our Instagram they can also check there what we provide. </p>
            <p>Our second page is the Discover our world page. On this page you find all the information about the Brand and the team. We have chosen to give a polaroid style to the pictures, so that it would be like memories and thus create a pleasant environment. All the corners of the shapes are round and the shape used the most is the circle. We have chosen for this to give our website a playful effect which suits our value fun. Thereby, it looks friendly which is an important value of the target group. Finally, it fits the value sportsmanship since circles and rounded corners are organic shapes. On the Discover Our World page we also chose to show the most of our colors again for that playful and fun effect. </p>
            <p>Our third page is the What We Offer page. On the page you find three packages all shaped with a picture first and then the text just like a polaroid. This is because with our teambuilding activities we want to make memories, and memories you capture in a photograph. The corners are round to give a friendly effect as explained before. At the bottom of every page is a footer where there is access to our Instagram account. This is to make it easy to follow us, and create a Stick Together team. </p>
            <p>Our fourth and last page is the contact page. There are many links to this page since we are eager for people to sign up. Even if they don‚Äôt want to buy the package they can ask us questions. The button of the sign up is the same as in all buttons form the other pages. We did this to create cohesiveness. The corners of the sign up sheet are again rounded and it looks like the polaroid without the picture to make it a whole.</p>
            <p>Lastly all colors and fonts that are used are also in our marketing campaign. We used the same colors and fonts to create an aesthetic so that we would be easy recognizable and that there would be a good link to the marketing strategy and the website. </p>

          <!-- End Production, start Marketing -->

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>For our marketing campaign, we chose to post different types of content, both as the type of content and in terms of goal for the content. Moreover, alternating in type of content, such as posts, stories and reels would also be good for getting higher in the algorithm. We got the inspiration for the content mainly from Instagram accounts, such as @NSBML, @Linda.meiden and @haarclipvanmarieclaire. These are Instagram accounts that are popular among our target group or have the same target group as us. Something that is very typical of these channels is that they use a lot of colour, don't necessarily post a lot of reels, but very much anticipate on recognition. They make sure that followers recognize themselves in the post and also encourage to start recognizing yourself in a post. In addition to this, these channels also want to spread positivity, also something we like to do. &nbsp;</p>
<p> Examples of what we want to post: </p>
<li> Inspirational quotes</li>
<li> Meme reels</li>
<li> Outfit inspiration </li>
<li> Who are you? </li>
<li> Supportive content on matchdays</li>
<p> At last we wanted to create unity between our website and our social media with our marketing plan. And that the content we‚Äôve created was close to our target group. That we have been very attuned to that particular audience.  </p>

<p> TARGET GOUP</p>
<p> After the given target group of teamsport players, we decided to focus on the following target group: 
Dutch female amateur hockeyplayers in the age group of 18 ‚Äì 27 (Gen-z)
The reason why we only want to focus on the Dutch female amateur hockeyplayers is because the Netherlands are a hockey country. This is even the new vision of the Dutch Hockey Federation is ‚Äò‚ÄôDutch people love hockey because they play it themselves, because they perform a function on or around the field, because they find it a fun sport to watch or because they are simply proud of the performance of the Dutch national team. Field hockey is as much a part of the Netherlands as our tulips, DJs and Dutch Design."
Since we also made the choice to focus on the Dutch target group, we will write all posts in Dutch. Both the descriptions and the text in the reels will be written in Dutch. This is to best speak the language of our target group and give them the idea that we speak that ''language'' as well.
</p>

<p> OBJECTIVES </p>
<p> Reach objective </p>
<li> 250 followers on Instagram (of which 80 are active)</li>
<li> an audience reach of at least 5.000</li>
<li> 100 followers on TikTok (of which 40 are active) </li>
<li> an audience reach of at least 20.000</li>

<p> Affect objective </p>
<li> Encouraging positive emotions such as bonding, enthusiasm and commitment within the field hockey community. </li>

<p> Response objectives </p>
<p> Response objective Instagram </p>
<li> in the first 2 weeks of the planning we want at least 100 interactions spread across 8 posts </li>
<li> and want it to be seen by at least 1.000 (more important)</li>
<p> Response objective Tiktok </p>
<li> in the first 2 weeks we want at least 100 interactions also, spread across 6 posts</li>
<li> we want the videos to be seen by at least 5.000 people (more important)</li>

<p> PLATFORMS USED </p>
<p> INSTAGRAM </p>
<p> According to Newcom's annual social media survey (2024), daily use of Instagram is on the rise in the 20-29 age group. About 60% of this age group reported using Instagram daily. And in the 20-24 age group, about 56% use Instagram daily . This is also in line with the interviews we did. Instagram was mentioned by all our interviewees as the most used social media platform. 
We also chose Instagram because it is the most all-round social media platform. Users can both interact with each other, post videos and photos and get inspiration from others. Instagram also offers the ability to tag businesses and products in posts. 
For the rest, many sports teams nowadays have their own Instagram account to attract businesses and recruit new team members or coaches, for example.

          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p> GENERAL </p>
<p> If we can say one thing about this project is that we've tried, things have gone well, things have gone differently, but most of all we've learned a lot.
At the beginning of the project, we took the wrong approach, which caused a delay for us in the project and therefore we didn‚Äôt had that much time to execute our campaign as fast as we wanted to in the beginning. And as a result, we made the decision to focus completely on Instagram for marketing. Also because Instagram has a lot features as stated before in this report. 
We did added our Tiktok objectives and ideas to this report as part of the reflection. 
The red threat hrough this whole marketing project is that‚Äôve been too much of a perfectionist. In the report will be explained when and how, but one of the biggest thing we‚Äôve learned is to let it go sometimes and that that is also okay. And you can even get good result if you do. 
</p>
<p> WHAT WORKED AND WHAT DIDN‚ÄôT? </p>
<p> WHAT WORKED? </p>
<li> Inspirational shopping pages (see post 7 and 11). </li>
<li> Make one personal responsible for the marketing. In de last 1,5 week we had still had a lot to do, so we made the decision that Tamar was gonna be responsible for the Marketing and social media. This made posting a lot easier. </li>
<li> Wat voor de rest nog opvallend was, dat de posts die maar maximaal </li>
<p> WHAT DIDN‚ÄôT WORK?</p>
<li> Quote posts didn‚Äôt go as expected. We thought that these posts would have done better since the style of the quotes is very popular on Pinterest and Instagram. </li>
<li> Putting a posts in the concepts of Instagram. We thought that once you‚Äôve put something in concepts that everyone had access to that post. But we didn‚Äôt. And therefore post 2 and the first stories were delayed. </li>
<li> We also wanted to have an direct interaction with our followers, because we thought is was nice to make them part of content and therefore they could feel more connected to our account. We posted an Instagram story with a question sticker and we posted a general post with a question to answer in the comments. But both posts didn‚Äôt work out and we got zero reactions. </li>
<p> WHAT WENT AS EXPECTED AND WHAT DIDN‚ÄôT?</p>
<p> WHAT WENT AS EXPECTED?</p>
<li> We did expect that the shopping posts would do well. We saw this in previous marketing projects, that if you tag brands or other relevant people we got more views and that the brands we‚Äôve tagged liked our posts as well. And indeed our ‚Äò‚Äôshopping posts‚Äô‚Äô got the most views and even a few companies (@Knekkinl, @dwrslabel and @brouwerijhetij) we tagged liked our posts. </li>

<p> We also acted on the buying behaviour of gen-z with these posts. Generation-Z is trend-sensitive and often buy a new item for a good feeling. And the inspiration for new items they get mainly through social media. </p>

<li> We also expected that our feed would look nice, because we are all very passionate about the design aspect of social media marketing. </li>

<p> WHAT DIDN‚ÄôT WENT AS EXPECTED? </p>
<li> At the beginning, we didn't take a strategic approach at all. There was a content calendar, but that was about it. There was not one person to post, so literally nothing got off the ground. The ideas were there, the qualities of the team were there, but there was 1 big enemy and that was communication. Communication was lacking. There was no one taking the lead and that's a shame. As a result, we communicated past each other and arrived at a concrete plan too late, leaving us behind. </li>
<li> When we had our first feedback session in class, multiple classmates gave us the tip to post more reels, and especially reels that are in meme style. A lot of people like to send those videos to their friends and tag them in the comments. So we did. We started posting reels related to the hockey people, but they didn‚Äôt achieved the reach we expected. When we compared our account to other accounts, we thought that we could at least get 200 views per reel, but we didn‚Äôt. </li>
<p> All our six reels together scored in total 388 views compared to 1200 views we expected to. </p>
<p> For our account the normal posts did better. We got more views and engagement to our posts. If we look at the statistics 1/3 of our involved account were on our posts and not our reels. </p>
<img src="images/picture-1.jpg" alt="reached accounts"> 
<li> Stories didn‚Äôt worked out. We didn‚Äôt realize that stories would only be seen by our followers. And specially in the beginning we didn‚Äôt get any following and therefore the views on our stories were low and didn‚Äôt had any impact, not even a like.  </li>
<li> At last we didn‚Äôt expect that it would take so long to get a lot of followers or at least 50. We think that people are nowadays more picky in following accounts. </li>
<p> WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY? </p>
<li> Definitely post more content. Let go of the perfectionism and just post. It sounds very easy to do, but we‚Äôre a team with all very perfectionistic people, which didn‚Äôt make it easy. We could easy spend 4 hour deciding on the fonts or a new colour to add to the styleguide. 
With more posts Instagram user could have clear view on our brand and made them maybe curious to follow us. 
</li>
<li> Make 1 person responsible for the marketing part of the project. Then that person could delegate the tasks within marketing to team members. That would have made it more easy to execute the marketing plan. </li>
<li> Stick to the planning. Making is a planning is one thing, but stick to it, is another thing. That is something we didn‚Äôt and therefore we got lost. </li>
<li> Make posts ahead and put them in a planning tool, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about if you have posted or not. </li>

<p> COMMPARING TO THE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA PLAN?</p>
<p> If we look back at our content planning you see that we didn‚Äôt post consistently and not according to our planning. This was all because of the points that we stated before in this report. Especially the posting times were not according to our content planning.
But if we look at our objectives we didn‚Äôt achieve the objective of 250 followers, we got 30 followers in total and approximately 17 of them were active (they saw our posts). Also the reach objective of an audience reach of 5000 was a little bit ambitious. In total we reached 776 accounts. Our most reach we got on the posts: 771 and on the reels: 112 views in total and on our stories: 29 views. This makes a total of 1497 views on our account. 
And of course are tiktok objectives not relevant because we didn‚Äôt use Tiktok in the end.
For the affective objective we wanted to encourage positive emotions such as bonding, enthusiasm and respect within the hockey community. We could anticipated more on this objective. We only made one post that really focused on positive support (post 6). Then the content would also be more in line with the content for our website. We were just more focused on which content got likes and views, instead of the message. 
For the response objective we wanted at least 100 interactions spread across 8 different posts. But in total we got 97 likes and 10 comments
</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <li> Would like to focus more on the sport itself now we posted mostly general stuff. Looking back on our content it could have been an account for a lifestyle brand and not necessarily a brand that wants to promote positivity in sports. So for the future we want to focus more on field hockey related content. This could include tricks, matched and news.</li>
<li> We will also need to pay more attention on Instagram statistics. So that we really pay better attention to which hashtags worked well and which times worked well, we really haven't looked at that well enough now. </li>
<li> We should also post more in English. Just to try if can get a bigger audience, since the posts will be understandable for more people. </li>
<li> Lastly, we could also experiment with paid ads, to see what that does to engagement and we can get more followers.</li>
          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>

            <li>Based on our problem interviews we found a common theme in the outcome from the questions. Problems that were consistent were mostly based on negativity and hate, like disrespect and rudeness from parent and supporters in the audience of games. Another problem we found was disrespect within the team where team members would turn on each other. Lastly, we wanted to focus on the negativity that comes from competitiveness. </li>
            <li>Negativity from the audience: whenever hockey players have a hockey match audiences and supporters like parents and friends may get noisy by yelling at hockey players or the coach when they don‚Äôt like something that‚Äôs going on in the game.</li>
            <li>Disrespect within the team: disrespect also happens inside the lines, we found that within all female hockey teams a lot of backstabbing and fighting happened during practices and sometimes even games, causing tension between the team and lowering the team spirit.</li>
            <li>Competitiveness: a silent killer for sure, a lot of girls want to be the best of their team. Because of this teams drift apart because everyone is just focusing on themselves and hockey is a team sport, not a solo sport. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To fix this problem, we investigated possible solutions to bring teams together. We found that the root of this problem goes back to the willingness of sacrificing a little bit of yourself so you can thrive as team. We wanted to bring girls together in way they could consider each other sisters, a community build on love and respect for each other. Our website is a gateway to team spirits allowing teams to reconnect and be the best version of themselves that they can be. On our website team will be able to book ‚Äúbootcamps‚Äù, these bootcamps consist of group activities which sole purpose are to build trust. They will go through different exercises that require the team to work as one. Depending on the state of their team spirit levels they can get the package deal that will help them the most. </li>          
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our customer segments are based on the research and interviews we did. We found that these people are willing to pay for our product, as they would benefit most from our product. They all play hockey, they‚Äôre all girls and most importantly, they all know they must be the best teams possible in order to get to the top. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our unique valuable position is based on other similar companies out there. There are other team exercise companies out there, but non that have that bootcamp like feeling you see in movies or social media.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Because we have all necessary resources available to us, we can build our company up with little to no cost. This causes us to be able to promote and get more out of our start up period and reach our goals easier in the long run. We also have first row insider knowledge of what these girls want as we have female hockey players in our team.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We decided to use Instagram as our main channel of communication cause based on our research and interviews, we found that this is still the main platform our target audience uses the most. Based on our Instagram posts compared to TikTok we found that this true, Instagram had much better reach to our specific target audience than TikTok. (See marketing above)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The best way to measure how successful we became is to look at our goal (which you can also find in the marketing section) is to see how many people viewed our website and how many people bought one of our team building packages. Based on views we can tell how big the demand is while based on actual purchase we can research how we can reach more people. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our revenue stream comes from the packages bought by costumers. Based on interviews teams and coaches agreed to pay a fair price if I meant to become a better team. </li>

            <li>Product Discription:</li>
            <p>Our product addresses the found problems prevalent in female hockey teams, focusing on negativity, disrespect, and competitiveness within the team and from the audience. Negativity often arises from the audience, with parents and supporters displaying rude or disrespectful behavior during matches, impacting players' morale and performance. Additionally, team conflicts within the team, backstabbing, and tension among team members during practices and games contribute to a toxic team environment. This excessive focus on individual performance rather than teamwork leads to division within the team, hindering overall performance.</p>
            <p>Our solution is to bring unity, respect, and teamwork within female hockey teams through a series of team-building activities and exercises. Our website serves as a platform to easily access this transformation, offering customizable "bootcamp" sessions tailored to address the specific needs of each team. Teams can book group activities focused on building trust, communication, and camaraderie among members, led by experienced coaches. On top of that, our platform promotes a sense of sisterhood and community among team members, highlighting mutual respect and support. Through our fresh approach, we aim to empower teams to reach their full potential, creating a positive and supportive team culture for sustained success on and off the field.</p>
